  "about_desc": "The group Macbeth was formed in 1986. The name comes from Shakespeare's play of the same name (the main character is the Scottish king 'Macbeth'). From the very beginning, they achieved relative success among listeners of their generation. In 1989, the group Macbeth performed for the first time appearing at a larger event. Then, in front of a packed hall, they were announced as the winners of the music festival Fest song 89. After this victory, their work certainly went from amateur to professional. The then first line-up consisted of: Hamza Ražnatović, Kenan Šahinović, Zenan Šahinović, Nermin Demirović and Erol Rosan. Near the end of 1995, Macbeth entered the studio 'Mak', where he began recording his first material 'Crne oči' and finished it in the summer of 1996. Zenan Šahinović, Muamer Stočević, Mladen Vitomir and Nihad Maličbegović. The songs 'Crne oči' and 'Odlazim daleko' from this album became very popular among listeners in a very short time and climbed to first place on most radio stations. They released 5 albums to date, namely: 'Crne oči', 'Kajlo stara', 'Samo Jedan Je', 'The Best Of' and 'Istinom'."
